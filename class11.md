## The HTML `<video>` Element

 To show a video in HTML, use the `<video>` element:

### How it Works

The `controls` attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include `width` and `height`attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The `<source>` element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the `<video>` and `</video>` tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the `<video>` element.
