   ### What is growth mindset?
 A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed
  **But aren’t some people naturally smarter than others?**

Yes and No. People are born with distinct genetic structures, which means they are initially superior to others in a variety of ways. Those with a growth mindset, on the other hand, believe that one can always improve, catch up, or even surpass the natural talents of others. Teachers can help shape a student's confidence and outlook on school by providing constructive, ongoing feedback. It is critical that “teachers who understand the growth mindset do everything they can to facilitate that learning.

### Fixed Mindset VS Growth Minset 

+ ***Fixed Mindset:*** “In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort.

+ ***Growth Mindset:*** “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and resilience that is essential for great accomplishment
