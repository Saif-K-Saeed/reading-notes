# HTTP Status Code to Use for Every CRUD App

## In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents

- 100’s = (informational status) header part of the request received, and they will go to transmission demand

   403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.
