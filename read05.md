# Operators and Loop 
## Operators
An operator, in computer programing, is a symbol that usually represents an action or process. These symbols were adapted from mathematics and logic. An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand.

Operators are the backbone of any program and they are used for everything from very simple functions like counting to complex algorithms like security encryption.

## Loop
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
### Different Kinds of Loops
- for - loops through a block of code a number of times

`for` (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {

  // code block to be executed

}
- for/in - loops through the properties of an object

`for` (key in object) {

  // code block to be executed

}
- for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object

`for` (variable of iterable) {

  // code block to be executed
  
}
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

`while` (condition) {
  // code block to be executed

}
- do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

`do` {

  // code block to be executed
}

`while` (condition);
