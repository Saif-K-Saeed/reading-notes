# SQL vs NoSQL

 *SQL* | *NoSQL*
---------- |------------|
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases RDBMS.|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases are table based databases.| NoSQL databases are document based.
SQL databases have predefined schema. |NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable.|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. |MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  - MySQL Community Edition

- Give a real world example.
  - MySql is available for all major platforms like Linux, Windows, Mac, BSD and Solaris. It also has connectors to languages like Node.js, Ruby, C#, C++, C, Java, Perl, PHP and Python.

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  - MongoDB

- Give a real world example.
  - Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance.
  - Scalability: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers.
  - Manageable: It is easy to use for both developers and administrators.

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  - Document based database like MongoDB, are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

- Which type of database is best for scalabilit
  - MongoDB it is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.

- What does SQL stand for?
  - Structured Query Language

- What is a realational database?
  - is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  - B-TREE ,collection of tables, each having a unique name. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values. Thus a table represents a collection of relationships. There is a direct correspondence between the concept of a table and the mathematical concept of a relation.

- What is a ‘schema’?
  - Is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information, represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database.

- What is a NoSQL database?
  - which stands for “not only SQL,” is an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational database.

- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  - MongoDB stores data records as documents which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why
  - MongoDB, some research has shown that the speed of MongoDB could be 100x faster than a relational database, and it has easy setup.

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  - don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
