# CSS
Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.



## What is CSS?
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.


## Why Use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

### HTML Attributes
- HTML elements can have attributes
- Attributes provide additional information about the element
- Attributes come in name/value pairs like charset="utf-8"

Example Explained.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.

- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
- The `lang` attribute  defines the language of the document
- The `<meta>` element contains meta information about the document
- The `charset` attribute defines the character set used in the document
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the document
- The `<body>` element contains the visible page content
- The `<h1>` element defines a large heading
- The `<p>` element defines a paragraph









# What is JavaScript?


- JavaScript is the **Programming Language** for the Web.

- JavaScript can update and change both **HTML** and **CSS**.

- JavaScript can **calculate**, **manipulate** and **validate** data.

#### JavaScript variables can be:
- Numbers
- Strings
- Objects
- Arrays
- Functions

name  | Example
----- |--------
Numbers |`var` x = 3.14;` var` y = 3;   
Strings|`var` carname = "Volvo XC60";  `var` carname = 'Volvo XC60';
Objects|`var` car = `{type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}`;
Arrays|`var` cars = `["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]`;
Functions |function myFunction(p1, p2) { `return p1 * p2;`   ` of p1 and p2`}

# Operators and Loop 
## Operators
An operator, in computer programing, is a symbol that usually represents an action or process. These symbols were adapted from mathematics and logic. An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand.

Operators are the backbone of any program and they are used for everything from very simple functions like counting to complex algorithms like security encryption.

## Loop
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
### Different Kinds of Loops
- for - loops through a block of code a number of times

`for` (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {

  // code block to be executed

}
- for/in - loops through the properties of an object

`for` (key in object) {

  // code block to be executed

}
- for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object

`for` (variable of iterable) {

  // code block to be executed
  
}
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

`while` (condition) {
  // code block to be executed

}
- do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

`do` {

  // code block to be executed
}

`while` (condition);
