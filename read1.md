## What is Markdown:question:

Markdown is a text-styling language for the web. You have complete control over how the 
document is displayed; for example, formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating 
lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Markdown is mostly just plain
text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, such as # or *.


#### You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the .md or .markdown extension

For more information, see [“Writing on GitHub”](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github) in the GitHub Help.

 #### Examples

* Text
* Lists 
* Images 
* Headers & Quotes 
* Code Extras
